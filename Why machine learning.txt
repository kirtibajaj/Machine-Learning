Why do we need MAchine Learning

* To build system which can continously learn and improve.....
   because if there are some changer lets take above ex: to recognize digit if       someone writing it differently so machine needs to learn...Writin program       everytime may be scary..

* To handle the explosion of data.
   because in companies today data is rising at a very good scale so learning each    time how a data can be managed will be problamatic for developer anyytime....so    handling this by machine works a lot.
   handling machine will just need
   - input power
   - maintainance one in a while
   - to handle volumes of data which the machine needs to completed


   
* To reduce mundace work for us....
   by us we mean here,developer team, product team, manager team or end user it    could be anything 
    for ex:-
     *if machine can learn from our past experiences that what kind of news we read
       and inspite of searching for that machine will itself provide us with that           kind of news will be beneficial for me....

* To reduce errors, improve efficiency......
  no matter we human works how hard but if we dowork again and again we may get a   distraction and commit sme mistakes and errors ....whereas if a machine learnt   something that means it will do that work with that effieciency as it can   do........

Where are we witnessing machine learning.....

Where are the s/w , mobile apps , or it be a website,backend system ....
which is looking at the system we do and how we use
and then actually use ML to improve and make it more efficient.
where we use such technology


* Google assistant(It is learning what are the things which we ask!!...
   what are the things which we search on day to day basis...what kind of    languages you use....how smartly you ask and search)

* Google Maps(is use for navigation purpose to drop us from point A to point B   specially)
  -Google maps go and search for which way will be the best ....among all the way
   which will be the more effiecient way
  - it keeps track of how and where you leave.

* Netflix "Recommendation movies for you.."
   it show more tv series , movies and documentary which we should see next because
   it is using ml ...when we see something it captures its type that kind of things    we ike to see and show us suggestion on the basis of that.

* Online Advertising....
  when we visit some website and using some other websites it shows us the adds   related to the previously visited websites...specially on the shopping carts

* Credit Card Fraud Detection...
  When we use credit card-then it save our data like
  - what amount frequenty we use it
  - what duration like once in a week
  - what range of money is used
  - what area do i use it
  - what pattern i use to use it
  - what are the most merchants to whom we do transaction

   If the card is stole then it may get used in a different pattern...it might not    be the way we are using it regularly so it may  get detected by the machine    learning...

*  Medical Diagnosis..
   Scams of digital images of various organs
   So machine learning is used to learn machine through these images that what kind    of problems through which is patient is going through.....

*  Self driving cars...
   past learning that on this road there is a speed breaker...
   condition of road was not that good
    what temp of AC does user like
    what kind of music does user like...
    so agin it is using MAchine learning there.......

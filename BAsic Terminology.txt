Basic ML Technology

Even in first step of Machine Learning we should be aware about the little bit of terminology.

-Machine Learning Model  :- MAthematical function  or whatever the way through                             which the machine learns is called as abstraction                               of data
-Features    :- Features are essentially the input variables

-Dependent Variables :- Output Variable through which the machine is trying to                         learn
-training dataset :- Part of dataset which is used to train the model or we can                       say feed into
-Test Dataset :- Part of dataset to test 
-Model Accuracy




*Where we teach the machine with(inputs/outputs) so that it can generate output for new inputs
-aka supervised learning
-Regression Analysis, Decision Tree

*Where the machine learn on its own
-aka unsupervised learning
-Cluster Analysis

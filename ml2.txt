What is machine learning???

When a machine learn without explicitly programmed.........
involve in developing s/w
*Product manager will tell this is what to implement
*What is the scope of the problem
*What are parameters
*What is the solution(what we want to build)

so then a developer will look into this matter and have better understanding of what should include or what not ....write it at proper place and make a s/w

Indirectly, this all going to trained the machine that what to do and how to do..............

Examples:-
*A machine shortlisting resumes for a job
*A machine recognizing handwritten digits

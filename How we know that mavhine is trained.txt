How do we know that the machine has learnt and is capable of handling the critical problems


-Firstly user collects a lot of data and it only give 70% of the data to train  the machine so basically the user train machine by 70% of data.
-then user test the machine with the remaining 30% of data and in this way
-Machine measures the accuracy of this
-this is called as the Train-Test-Cycle


*It is very important that the user smartly chooses the subset to use to train the machine
After wards machine may uses whatever technique it want to use depends upon the type of data used.It may use
-Regression analysis 
- cluster analysis
-Decision tree

WE will intially train it and then we will test it with different-2 dataset once the machine started working with accuracy we will consider that the machine has learnt.
